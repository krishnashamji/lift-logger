# 🏋️‍♂️ Lift Logger (v1)

**Lift Logger** is a minimalist workout logging app built to help you track your strength training with ease. In its first version, the app allows you to create workouts, log exercises, and track your progress over time.

## 🚀 Vision

While v1 is focused on workout tracking, **Lift Logger** is designed to evolve into a **modular health platform**. The core idea is to let users **enable or disable "extensions"**—feature modules that add or remove functionality and navigation items—so they can tailor the app to fit their personal health journey.

Think of it as a super app for health—fitness, nutrition, recovery, and more—built around your needs.
